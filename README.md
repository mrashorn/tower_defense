tower_defense is a project based on what I learned in Python Crash Course after
building the Alien Invasion game from the book. I wanted to take what I learned
and build something from scratch without help from the book. 

This was just a big review of OOP. This was a learning exercise, the code
has not been refactored or improved after it's initial creation, except whatever
issues I was fixing as I was building the game. 

Initially I wanted to have better visuals and more customization for the game
but the time commitment required would not be appropriate since this was 
just an OOP learning project. 

To play:

```
python3 td.py
```
